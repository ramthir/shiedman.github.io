Enter Proteus and Julia


**PROTEUS**

Have patience, [gentle][1] Julia.

[1]: {{page.q}}=17496  "gentle (adj.) 2: courteous, friendly, kind"

**JULIA**

I must, where is no remedy.


**PROTEUS**

When possibly I can, I will return.


**JULIA**

If you [turn][2] not, you will return the sooner.
Keep this [remembrance][3] for thy Julia's sake.
She gives him a ring

[2]: {{page.q}}=6130  "turn (v.) 1: change, transform, alter"
[3]: {{page.q}}=16601  "remembrance (n.) 4: love-token, keepsake, memento"

**PROTEUS**

Why, then, we'll make exchange; here, take you this.
He gives her a ring


**JULIA**

And seal the bargain with a holy kiss.


**PROTEUS**

Here is my hand for my true constancy;
And when that hour [o'erslips][4] me in the day
Wherein I sigh not, Julia, for thy sake,
The next ensuing hour some foul mischance
Torment me for my love's forgetfulness!
My father stays my coming. Answer not.
The tide is now – nay, not thy tide of tears;
That tide will [stay][5] me longer than I should.
Julia, farewell! (Exit Julia) What, gone without a word?
Ay, so true love should do; it cannot speak,
For truth hath better deeds than words to grace it.
Enter Panthino

[4]: {{page.q}}=11916  "overslip (v.): pass by unnoticed, slip past"

**PANTHINO**

Sir Proteus, you are stayed for.


**PROTEUS**

                  Go; I come.
(aside) Alas, this parting strikes poor lovers dumb.
Exeunt
