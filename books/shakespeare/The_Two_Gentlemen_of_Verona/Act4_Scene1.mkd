Enter certain Outlaws


**FIRST OUTLAW**

Fellows, stand fast; I see a [passenger][1].

[1]: {{page.q}}=12622  "passenger (n.): wayfarer, traveller, passer-by"

**SECOND OUTLAW**

If there be ten, shrink not, but down with 'em.

Enter Valentine and Speed


**THIRD OUTLAW**

[Stand][2], sir, and throw us that you have about ye;
If not, we'll make you sit, and [rifle][3] you.

[2]: {{page.q}}=14055  "stand (v.) 3: stop, halt"
[3]: {{page.q}}=17175  "rifle (v.): search and rob, plunder"

**SPEED**

Sir, we are [undone][4]; these are the villains
That all the travellers do fear so much.

[4]: {{page.q}}=7007  "undone (adj.): ruined, destroyed, brought down"

**VALENTINE**

My friends –


**FIRST OUTLAW**

That's not so, sir; we are your enemies.


**SECOND OUTLAW**

Peace! We'll hear him.


**THIRD OUTLAW**

Ay, by my beard, will we; for he's a [proper][5] man.

[5]: {{page.q}}=12275  "proper (adj.) 1: good-looking, handsome, comely"

**VALENTINE**

Then know that I have little wealth to lose;
A man I am [cross][6]ed with adversity;
My riches are these poor [habiliment][7]s,
Of which, if you should here [disfurnish][8] me,
You take the sum and substance that I have.

[6]: {{page.q}}=2937  "cross (v.) 3: afflict, plague, go against"
[7]: {{page.q}}=18369  "habiliment, abiliment (n.): (usually plural) clothes, dress, attire, outfit"
[8]: {{page.q}}=9168  "disfurnish (v.): deprive, strip, dispossess"

**SECOND OUTLAW**

Whither travel you?


**VALENTINE**

To Verona.


**FIRST OUTLAW**

Whence came you?


**VALENTINE**

From Milan.


**THIRD OUTLAW**

                  Have you long [sojourned][9] there?

[9]: {{page.q}}=5910  "sojourn (v.) 1: pause, reside, stay for a while"


**VALENTINE**

Some sixteen months, and longer might have stayed,
If [crooked][10] fortune had not thwarted me.

[10]: {{page.q}}=3507  "crooked (adj.) 1: malignant, perverse, contrary, devious"

**FIRST OUTLAW**

What, were you banished thence?


**VALENTINE**

I was.


**SECOND OUTLAW**

For what offence?


**VALENTINE**

For that which now torments me to [rehearse][11]:
I killed a man, whose death I much repent;
But yet I slew him manfully in fight,
Without [[false][14]][13] [vantage][15] or [base][12] treachery.

[11]: {{page.q}}=16751  "rehearse (v.) 1: relate, recount, give an account of"

[15]: {{page.q}}=7313  "vantage (n.) 2: advantageous position, place of vantage, superiority"

**FIRST OUTLAW**

Why, ne'er repent it, if it were done so.
But were you banished for so small a fault?


**VALENTINE**

I was, and held me glad of such a [doom][16].

[16]: {{page.q}}=8461  "doom (n.) 1: judgement, sentence, decision"

**SECOND OUTLAW**

Have you the [tongue][17]s?

[17]: {{page.q}}=6253  "tongue (n.) 2: (plural) foreign language"

**VALENTINE**

My youthful travel therein made me [happy][18],
Or else I often had been miserable.

[18]: {{page.q}}=18455  "happy (adj.) 3: accomplished, favoured, proficient"

**THIRD OUTLAW**

By the bare scalp of Robin Hood's fat friar,
This fellow were a king for our wild [faction][19]!

[19]: {{page.q}}=19772  "faction (n.) 1: party, group, set [of people]"

**FIRST OUTLAW**

We'll have him. Sirs, a word.
The Outlaws draw aside to talk


**SPEED**

Master, be one of them; it's an honourable kind of
thievery.


**VALENTINE**

Peace, villain!


**SECOND OUTLAW**

Tell us this: have you anything to [take][20]
to?

[20]: {{page.q}}=6610  "take to (v.) 2: subsist on, use as a resource"

**VALENTINE**

Nothing but my fortune.


**THIRD OUTLAW**

Know then that some of us are gentlemen,
Such as the fury of ungoverned youth
Thrust from the company of [awful][21] men;
Myself was from Verona banished
For [practising][22] to steal away a lady,
An heir, and near [allied][23] unto the Duke.

[21]: {{page.q}}=247  "awful (adj.) 1: awe-inspiring, worthy of respect"
[22]: {{page.q}}=12234  "practise (v.) 1: plot, scheme, conspire"
[23]: {{page.q}}=1243  "allied (adj.): related, connected"

**SECOND OUTLAW**

And I from Mantua, for a gentleman
Who, in my [mood][24], I stabbed unto the heart.

[24]: {{page.q}}=10637  "mood (n.) 1: anger, fury, frenzy, fit of temper"

**FIRST OUTLAW**

And I for such [like][25] petty crimes as these.
But to the [purpose][26] – for we cite our faults
That they may hold excused our lawless lives;
And partly, seeing you are beautified
With goodly shape, and by your own report
A linguist, and a man of such perfection
As we do in our [quality][27] much want –

[25]: {{page.q}}=19136  "like (adj.) 1: same, similar, alike, equal"
[26]: {{page.q}}=12296  "purpose (n.) 2: point at issue, matter in hand"
[27]: {{page.q}}=13794  "quality (n.) 8: companions, associates, fraternity"

**SECOND OUTLAW**

Indeed, because you are a banished man,
Therefore, above the rest, we [parle][28]y to you.
Are you [content][29] to be our general –
To make a virtue of necessity,
And live as we do in this wilderness?

[28]: {{page.q}}=13054  "parle, parley (v.) 1: discuss terms, treat, negotiate with"
[29]: {{page.q}}=2862  "content (adj.) 1: agreeable, willing, ready"

**THIRD OUTLAW**

What sayst thou? Wilt thou be of our [consort][30]?
Say ‘ ay,’ and be the captain of us all.
We'll do thee homage, and be ruled by thee,
Love thee as our commander and our king.

[30]: {{page.q}}=3192  "consort (n.) 2: company, mob, crew"

**FIRST OUTLAW**

But if thou scorn our courtesy, thou diest.


**SECOND OUTLAW**

Thou shalt not live to [brag][31] what we have offered.

[31]: {{page.q}}=2253  "brag (v.): talk with pride [about], sound off [about]"

**VALENTINE**

I take your offer, and will live with you,
Provided that you do no outrages
On [silly][33] women or poor [passenger][32]s.

[32]: {{page.q}}=12622  "passenger (n.): wayfarer, traveller, passer-by"
[33]: {{page.q}}=13896  "silly (adj.) 1: helpless, defenceless, vulnerable"

**THIRD OUTLAW**

No, we detest such vile [base][34] practices.
Come, go with us; we'll bring thee to our [crew][35]s,
And show thee all the treasure we have got;
Which, with ourselves, all rest at thy [dispose][36].
Exeunt

[34]: {{page.q}}=1412  "base (adj.) 1: dishonourable, low, unworthy"
[35]: {{page.q}}=3449  "crew (n.) 1: band, company, body of men"
