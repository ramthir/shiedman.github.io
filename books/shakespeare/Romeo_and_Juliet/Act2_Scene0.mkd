_Enter Chorus_

**CHORUS**

Now old desire doth in his deathbed lie,
And young [affection][1] [gape][2]s to be his heir.
That [fair][3] for which love groaned for and would die,
With tender Juliet matched, is now not fair.
Now Romeo is beloved and loves again,
Alike bewitched by the [charm][4] of looks.
But to his foe supposed he must [complain][5],
And she steal love's sweet bait from [fearful][6] hooks.
Being held a foe, he may not have access
To [breathe][7] such vows as lovers [use][8] to swear,
And she as much in love, her means much less
To meet her new beloved anywhere.
But passion lends them power, time means, to meet,
[Temper][11]ing [extremities][9] with extreme [sweet][10].
