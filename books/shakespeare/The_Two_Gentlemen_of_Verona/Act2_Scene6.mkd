Enter Proteus


**PROTEUS**

To leave my Julia, shall I be forsworn;
To love fair Silvia, shall I be [forsworn][1];
To wrong my friend, I shall be much forsworn.
And e'en that [power][2] which gave me first my oath
Provokes me to this threefold perjury:
Love bade me swear, and Love bids me forswear.
O [sweet-suggesting][3] Love, if thou hast sinned,
Teach me, thy tempted subject, to excuse it!
At first I did adore a twinkling star,
But now I worship a celestial sun.
[Unheedful][5] vows may [heedfully][4] be broken;
And he [want][7]s [wit][9] that wants [resolved][6] [will][8]
To [learn][10] his wit t' exchange the bad for better.
Fie, fie, [unreverend][11] tongue, to call her bad
Whose [sovereignty][13] so [oft][12] thou hast preferred
With twenty thousand soul-confirming oaths!
I cannot [leave][14] to love, and yet I do;
But there I leave to love where I should love.
Julia I lose, and Valentine I lose;
If I keep them, I needs must lose myself;
If I lose them, thus find I by their loss:
For Valentine, myself; for Julia, Silvia.
I to myself am dearer than a friend,
For love is [still][15] most precious in itself;
And Silvia – witness heaven, that made her fair! –
Shows Julia but a swarthy [Ethiop][16]e.
I will forget that Julia is alive,
Remembering that my love to her is dead;
And Valentine I'll hold an enemy,
Aiming at Silvia as a sweeter [friend][17].
I cannot now prove constant to myself
Without some treachery used to Valentine.
This night he meaneth with a corded ladder
To climb celestial Silvia's chamber-window,
Myself in counsel, his [competitor][18].
Now [presently][19] I'll give her father notice
Of their disguising and [pretended][20] flight,
Who, all enraged, will banish Valentine,
For Thurio he intends shall wed his daughter;
But Valentine being gone, I'll quickly [cross][21]
By some sly trick [blunt][22] Thurio's [dull][23] proceeding.
Love, lend me wings to make my [purpose][24] swift,
As thou hast lent me [wit][26] to plot this [drift][25]!
