### REGIMES

#### Exercise No. 1.

We begin, first, with simple imaginary sensations. Recall a single rose, and imagine its fragrance. Now place yourself in mind before a hill of roses, and imagine the air to be heavy with their fragrance. What would be the effect upon yourself? What would you do in such a case? Repeat this exercise with a drop of musk. Then think of a lake of musk. Repeat with the notes of a songbird. Then imagine a forest full of birds, all singing.

*[musk]: 
     
These exercises should be conducted in a quiet room. Bring the Will to bear with great power upon the work. Make the imagination as strong and distinct as possible. Repeat until the imaginary sensations become as vivid as in life.

#### Exercise No. 2.

Stand by the side of some running stream, or near a waterfall, or in a factory in operation. Now listen attentively to the sounds that assail your ears. There is one general combination of sound. What is it like? What does it recall to memory? What mood does it bring to your soul? After you have become familiar with the whole effect, proceed to analyze it into as many different notes as you can detect. When you have done this thoroughly, have separated the whole sound into its component parts, imagine clearly and powerfully, a great volume of one of these sounds, making it as loud as possible; then continue with another, and a third, and so on, until the general combination has been exhausted.

     
Lastly, go away from a source of real sound to a quiet place, and recall, first the general harmony, and then its individual sounds as previously analyzed. Continue until the exercise may be carried on with perfect ease.

#### Exercise No. 3.

Recall to memory some distant and real landscape. The difficulty will consist in bringing up the details, but these must be supplied. Resolute practice will accomplish the result desired. By a supreme effort make the mental picture as real as life. In doing this you should try to reinstate the soul's moods occasioned by the original scene. Place yourself, in thought, on the exact spot where first you saw the landscape, and resolutely compel the view to rise before you with as much of detail as possible. Keep the willful mood, and continue with different landscapes until you can summon a vivid picture of real scenery with the greatest ease.

*[reinstate]: To reinstate a law, facility, or practice means to start having it again. 

#### Exercise No. 4.

Recall some experience which has made a lasting impression upon your memory. Pass again in thought through its various phases, slowly, carefully, with great intensity of feeling. Dwell upon its cause, its accessories, and its effect upon you at the time. Was the effect pleasant or otherwise? In either case, state why. What influence had it upon your subsequent life? Would you repeat it? If not, why not? If so, may it again be secured, and how? May it be avoided in the future, and how? Continue with various experiences until the lessons of caution and thoughtful self interest become permanent factors in your mind. 

*[accessories]: You can use accessory to describe something which is part of an activity or process, but not the most essential or important part of it. (FORMAL) 

#### Exercise No. 5.

In a quiet room, construct imaginary pictures, such as you have never seen: of a bird, grotesque and unreal; of an animal, curious yet beautiful, or perfectly tame but horrible; of a building, magnificent yet mysterious; of a landscape, weird and entrancing or wild but not forbidding. Do not allow the mind to wander into reverie. You should preserve the Will mood as strongly as possible. Continue until control of the imagination has been secured.

*[grotesque]: You say that something is grotesque when it is so unnatural, unpleasant, and exaggerated that it upsets or shocks you. 
*[tame]: A tame animal or bird is one that is not afraid of humans. 
*[magnificent]: If you say that something or someone is magnificent, you mean that you think they are extremely good, beautiful, or impressive. 
*[entrancing]: fill sb with great emotion and delight as if by magic
*[wild]: Wild land is natural and is not used by people.
*[reverie]: A reverie is a state of imagining or thinking about pleasant things, as if you are dreaming. (FORMAL) 

#### Exercise No. 6.

Gaze at some large object, and try to discover in or about it a suggestion for the play of imagination. It is a horse? Give it wings, and journey to a distant planet. It is a spool of thread? Make it to be a spider's web wherewith to weave a thousand robes or with which to send messages without unwinding by charging with intensest Will power as you breathe upon it. Continue with other objects and various fanciful imaginings until Will is master of imagination, to call up, to control or to banish.

     
Select a sentence from a standard author, which illustrates the celerity of a trained imagination, and then will into the mind the complete picture suggested. 


*[spool]: A spool is a round object onto which thread, tape, or film can be wound, especially before it is put into a machine. 
*[wherewith]: with or by means of which <metal tools wherewith to break ground â€• Russell Lord>
*[weave]: If you weave cloth or a carpet, you make it by crossing threads over and under each other using a frame or machine called a loom. 
*[celerit]: rapidity of motion or action

#### Exercise No. 7.	

Thus, Lowell, in "A Moosehead Journal," writes: "Sometimes a root fence stretched up its bleaching antlers, like the trophies of a giant hunter." The man who said this tells us that "the divine faculty is to see what everybody can look at." The "divine faculty" of "seeing" should be cultivated. And it may become an Aladdin's Lamp to him whose Will is mighty. Try, now, to picture this root fence of Lowell's scene in such a way as to suggest bleaching antlers. Why did the writer bleach the antlers? Why did he not see them poised upon a row of deer-heads ?

*[bleaching]: If you bleach something, you use a chemical to make it white or pale in colour. 
*[trophies]: A trophy is something that you keep in order to show that you have done something very difficult. 

     
Having ascertained what the imaginative element is in such sentences (you can find similar everywhere), proceed to write some statement in which a like play of fancy is obtained. Do not be discouraged. Throw yourself into the mood of imagination. Practice this entire exercise persistently until you can with ease secure the mood and write a sentence of imaginative beauty.

     
The old injunction, "Know thyself," is by most people sadly neglected. It is worth a deal of labor to get acquainted with this "unknown land." Lowell writes that "a man should have traveled thoroughly round himself and the great terra incognita just outside and inside his own threshold, before he undertakes voyages of discovery to other worlds." This is largely true even of mental voyages. "Who hath sailed about the world of his own heart," quotes Lowell from Thomas Fuller, "sounded every creek, surveyed each corner, but that still there remains much 'terra incognita' to himself ?"

*[terra]: dry land; the ground (contrasted with water or air)
*[incognita]: unknown territory : an unexplored country or field of knowledge
*[creek]: A creek is a small stream or river. (AM) 

     
It would be well if, before trying to read, we could learn how to read; before trying to study, we could learn how to study. These exercises, therefore, have in view the cultivation of one of the greatest of human faculties. They deal with simple matters because this would seem to be best, and they aim at suggestiveness only; but if they are faithfully followed they will result in a developed imagination and, which is particularly to the point here, an increased power of Will of the greatest value in practical life. Continue these exercises indefinitely. 

#### Exercise No. 8.

Examine a machine of not very complex construction, Know its purpose. Understand all its parts and their mutual relations. When you have thoroughly analyzed the mechanism, close your eyes and summons it before the mind. Persist in this endeavor until you are able to form a vivid mental picture of the whole. Then mentally take it to pieces. Then mentally put the parts together. Now try to suggest some improvement by which some of the parts may be omitted, or by which parts may be better adjusted, or by which the machine may be made to accomplish better or less expensive work. Continue this exercise with various mechanisms until you are able to see into machinery, can call up to mind its inner construction, and can with ease form mental pictures of its wholes and its parts. 

*[mutual]: JOINT

#### Exercise No. 9.

Think of some matter in your life or home or place of business where a simple device or mechanism would prove valuable by a saving of time or money. The opportunity being found, proceed to think out a suitable arrangement for the purpose. Do not become absorbed in this effort to the injury of other interests. The object here is not to make inventors, but to develop power of imagination in order that motives of Will and consequences of action may be clearly perceived. Make this exercise, therefore, a study to such end. Above all, keep a strong sense of Will thoroughly in mind. Continue until you have acquired facility in the constructive imagination.

#### Exercise No. 10.

Recall one of your great mistakes in life, review carefully, intensely, the various motives which appealed to you at that time. Think over their relations, their force, their persistence. Judge candidly whether you deliberated sufficiently before acting. Remember distinctly that you did not give all motives or reasons an adequate hearing. Acknowledge exactly why you yielded to some motives and rejected others. Bring all these matters before your mind with the vividness of a present experience. Then review all the consequences of your then choice. In what respect do you now see that you ought to have proceeded differently? Had you so done, what would probably have been the outcome? Suppose you were now to be put back into the former circumstances. How would you decide with present knowledge? To avoid a similar mistake in the future, you must then do what you have failed to do, namely, deliberate carefully, summon all motives into court, hear each plea, give to all adequate consideration and weight, and vividly foresee all consequences of choice as far as possible.

*[candidly]:When you are candid about something or with someone, you speak honestly.  
     

The present exercise is designed to assist you to these desired ends. Continue such review work, until you have called up for examination all mistakes which you can remember. Meanwhile mightily resolve to fore-fend the future by giving every important matter utmost careful attention.

#### Exercise No. 11.

Recall to memory some very attractive bit[^1] of landscape observed in your travels. Let us say it is a great piece of woods seen in autumn. Picture this scene to the soul: the undulating ground, covered with fallen leaves and dotted[^2] by occasional clumps of bushes; the many colors of the foliage still crowning the trees, whose numberless trunks lift into the canopy above and afford sunlit vistas in every direction; the play of the winds upon the gleaming leaves, fallen and drooping and still clinging; the vast quiet which broods over all, save when broken by the sighing of the breeze or the call of birds from the open; the swiftly moving stealth of squirrels along the ground or among the branches; and the strange and pleasurable moods suggested when you stood there in nature's haunt of beauty.

[^1]: A bit of something is a small part or section of it. 
[^2]: When things dot a place or an area, they are scattered or spread all over it. 

*[undulating]: Something that undulates has gentle curves or slopes, or moves gently and slowly up and down or from side to side in an attractive manner. (LITERARY) 
*[clumps]: A clump of things such as trees or plants is a small group of them growing together.
*[foliage]: The leaves of a plant are referred to as its foliage. 
*[canopy]: any overhanging covering
*[sunlit]: lighted by or as if by the sun
*[vista]: A vista is a view from a particular place, especially a beautiful view from a high place.
*[gleaming]: If an object or a surface gleams, it reflects light because it is shiny and clean. 
*[breeze]: A breeze is a gentle wind. 
*[haunt]: place visited frequently by the person or people named. (revisit the haunts of one's youth)

     
Now invent reflections in connection with this scene. Proceed first, by the law of similarity. Of what does it remind you? You are to make the scene you have imagined the basis and cause of other scenes similar in one or more respects and you are deliberately to analyze the suggestion, the two scenes by comparison and the moods of thought occasioned by both, with reasons for the same. Do not fall into reverie. This is downright work. Its value depends altogether upon the amount of Will which you put into it, and the intelligence with which you control the mind during the labor involved.

     
Proceed, now, to make this scene the basis and cause of another scene by contrast. You are to repeat the above exercise in all respects, except that contrast, and not similarity, is to furnish your material.

     
Follow these directions daily until their full value is apparent in imagination entirely under control of Will.

#### Exercise No. 12.

The above directions may be repeated by substituting experience for scenery, proceeding, first, by similarity, and then by contrast. In all cases be strongly conscious of the willing sense. Continue the exercise indefinitely.

*[scenery]: The scenery in a country area is the land, water, or plants that you can see around you. 


####    Exercise No. 13.

Read some famous poem of the imagination. It will be better to commit it to memory. Having thoroughly mastered it, by understanding every word, and by vividly picturing in the mind every element of fancy, go on to analyze it, making a clear statement in writing of its consecutive thoughts. Then note carefully every specimen of imagination which it contains. Then determine its faults and its beauties as a work of the imagination. Then observe the relation and dependence of one element upon another. Then ascertain the secret of its beauty and of its power upon thought and feeling. Learn why it has lived and exerts its acknowledged influence. What is that influence? Continue this exercise indefinitely until you have mastered many of the world's great poems.

*[consecutive]: Consecutive periods of time or events happen one after the other without interruption. 
*[exerts]: If someone or something exerts influence, authority, or pressure, they use it in a strong or determined way, especially in order to produce a particular effect. (FORMAL) 


####    Exercise No. 14.

In a similar manner, read some famous book (not fiction), and treat its imaginative elements as secrets to be discovered and explained. Continue this work with the best in your library.


#### Exercise No. 15.

Take a work of fiction, and give it a similar analysis. You are now dealing with pictures of life and human nature. Read so as to obtain a vivid portrait of each character. Become thoroughly acquainted with all the personages of the book. Study the reasons for their actions. Investigate their motives. Note the influence of ancestry and environment upon them. Observe whether or not they are acting in a manner that is true to life. Would you act differently? And why? Appreciate the fact that they reason falsely and do not adequately consider all reasons involved in choice, and hence, do not give due weight[^3] to the best motives that appeal to them. Go on to follow their conduct to consequences. Are these natural, demanded by previous acts and conditions? Could the characters have been improved? Or the plot? Or the general developments of the persons? Or the outcome of their actions and relations?

*[personages]: A personage is a character in a play or book, or in history. (FORMAL) 
*[ancestry]: line of descent : LINEAGE especially : honorable, noble, or aristocratic descent 

[^3]: If something is given a particular weight, it is given a particular value according to how important or significant it is.
     
Make the book a piece of real life, and study it as above suggested, in order, first, that you may thoroughly understand it, and, secondly, that you may apply its lessons to your own life. Continue until you have mastered the best works of fiction in English.

     
In all this remember that you are cultivating the imagination for the purpose of discovering reasons for or against conduct and of appreciating consequences. By as much as you so discover and appreciate in real life must your Will become strengthened and its determination wiser.

*[conduct]: The conduct of a task or activity is the way in which it is organized and carried out. 

"The determinate exercise of the Judgment," say Professor W. B. Carpenter, "which involves the comparison of ideas, can only take place under the guidance of the Will."

#### Exercise No. 16.

Suppose yourself to be about to take a certain step or to perform a certain act. It is a matter of vital importance. You wish to make no mistake, for your happiness and welfare depend upon your decision. But how are you to proceed? You may choose one thing or the other.

     
The wisdom of your choice involves the adequate consideration of two matters, motives and consequences. Apprehended consequences are motives, but this division is convenient Under motives may be arranged reasons for and against either choice; under consequences all outcome which you can see as likely or probably to follow your decision. If you have cultivated memory, the recollection of other similar problems which you have bee compelled to solve will come to your assistance.

     
If you have cultivated imagination, you will be enabled to see clearly the motives that appeal to you, and you will also have power to imagine yourself as entering upon one course of procedure, passing through possible consequent experiences and reaping ultimate outcomes. Here will appear the values of preceding exercises But above all, you should bring to this imaginary problem (a real problem will serve better) a vivid sense of its reality and importance, and a feeling of strong resolution to consider it with all your might, and to solve it in the best possible manner.

Now note the balance of judgment: "To go, or not to go." Then proceed to review each case, and carefully strike out all reasons that offset one another, noting, again, at the last, the general balance of judgment: "To go, or not to go." If the two general judgments disagree, set the matter aside for future consideration. If they agree, hold the matter in abeyance a time, but resolve to decide definitely after sufficient opportunity for final reflection. If then you are in doubt, stay where you are.



The above are rough suggestions merely. They set forth what intelligent people always substantially do with reference to matters of importance. They are here offered because many even intelligent men seem wanting in the power clearly to see motives and possible consequences connected with momentous decisions. There are strong Wills which are not wisely exercised because of a simple lack of imaginative thinking. Many Wills are like guns set with hair triggers, they go off before good aim can be taken. Deliberation is worth gold and stocks, and it fore fends against sorrow. But a good deliberation depends largely upon the imaginative power of the soul. Our great trouble in life is that we "didn't know it was loaded." It is the work of the Will controlled imagination to know.

Here is the great prophet of success. " Where the Will is healthy the vision must be correct."

Though creative imagination is one of the mind's most wonderful qualities, yet nowhere in school or college do we find systematic instruction in this art. All the way from primeval man through the swing of the centuries and the upward march of mankind, the imagination has been the basis of progress. As a writer on psychology puts it "The products of the constructive imagination have been the only stepping stones for material progress. The constructive imagination of early man, aided by thought, began to conquer the world. When the winter cold came, the imagination pictured the skin of the animal on the human body. Will power going out in action: merely made that image a reality. The chimney, the stove, the stagecoach, the locomotive, are successive milestones, showing the progressive march of the imagination.

"Every time we tell a story clearly so as to impress the details on the mind of others, every time we describe a place or a landscape vividly, every time we relate what we have read in a book of travels so as to arouse definite images in the minds of our hearers, we are cultivating imagination. It is excellent training for a person to attempt to describe to others a meadow, a grove, an orchard, the course of a brook, the sky at sunrise, the starry heavens. If his description is not heavy, like unleavened bread, the liveliness will be due to the activity of his imagination."

The healthy Will is that which is bent on achieving right personal success by right methods, because self is a unit in the world's complex whole, which is slowly evolving the right universal Will.

The law of all this individual evolution is the double law of self knowledge and adjustment.

That this law may "come good" in your case, you need to cultivate, and rightly use, yourself and your relations with the world. It is here that imagination plays its part. Who are you? Find that out. What is your best adjustment to the world? Find that out. Learn to see things (in self in world), first, as they really are; secondly, as they should be for all-round welfare, Then carry out the vision.

The Will must not only be strong; it must also act wisely. Its realest motto is:

**I RESOLVE TO WILL WITH POWER, AND FOR THE BEST.**

**THEREFORE, ATTENTION! TO REASONS AND TO CONSEQUENCES !!**
