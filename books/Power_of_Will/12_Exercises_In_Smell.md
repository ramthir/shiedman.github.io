### REGIMES

#### Exercise No. 1

> Take some fragrant flower. Inhale its odor. Walk about the room, away from the flower. Now recall the quality and intensity of the smell. Repeat this exercise with various extracts and perfumes taken separately. Care must be had to give the nostrils sufficient rest between whiles, otherwise the sense of smell will become confused.

*[fragrant]: Something that is fragrant has a pleasant, sweet smell.
*[extracts]: An extract is a substance that has been obtained from something else, for example by means of a chemical or industrial process. 

#### Exercise No. 2.

> Procure two different kinds of extracts. Inhale the odor of one. Do the same with the other. Think strongly of the first odor; then of the second. Now try to compare them, noting the difference. 

#### Exercise No. 3.

While sitting erect, gently inhale the air, and try to name any odor perceived. Is it real? Where does it originate? Let friends secrete some odoriferous substance in a room, a number of pink roses or an open bottle of perfumery, not known to you, and while you are in another room. Enter and endeavor by smell alone to find the article. All other pronounced odors must be excluded from the place. 

*[odoriferous]: yielding an odor
*[endeavor]: to attempt (as the fulfillment of an obligation) by exertion of effort

#### Exercise No. 4.

Ask some friend to hold in the hand an object which is not known to you and is fragrant or odoriferous. He is to hold the article some distance from you, and then gradually to move it, held unseen in his two hands placed together, nearer and nearer, until you perceive the odor. Note the distance at which you perceive the object by smell. Can you name the smell? Can you name the object? Repeat the experiment with intervals of rest, with various different "smellable" articles.
