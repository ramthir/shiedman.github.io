### REGIMES

#### Rule 1.

>    Food should be regulated according to peculiarities of body and general work performed. Water which is pure should be freely drunk. Plenty of sound sleep should be secured, and slumber should be enhanced by plenty of pure air. Most people drink too little water. The air of many sleeping rooms is foul. Regularity of habits should be cultivated. Sufficient exercise must be taken to keep the muscles from degeneration and to vitalize the blood by activity of lungs.

*[slumber]: sleep, esp peacefully and comfortably
*[foul]: If you describe something as foul, you mean it is dirty and smells or tastes unpleasant. 
*[degeneration]: If you say that someone or something degenerates, you mean that they become worse in some way, for example weaker, lower in quality, or more dangerous. 

#### Rule 2.

>    Rest is also important. For the laboring man absolute idleness is not always rest; interested activity which brings unused muscles into play is better. This general truth lies at the bottom of popular employment of the day called Sunday. But such employment is largely injurious rather than beneficial. It frequently involves wrong methods as well as various excesses. The most wholesome rest as yet discovered for that day is suggested by religion. If you sneer at this proposition, that shows that you do not know what real religion is, or that your Will is set in directions contrary to the deepest instincts of mankind. 


*[excess]: An excess of something is a larger amount than is needed, allowed, or usual.
*[wholesome]: If you describe something as wholesome, you approve of it because you think it is likely to have a positive influence on people's behaviour or mental state, especially because it does not involve anything sexually immoral. 
*[sneer]: If you sneer at someone or something, you express your contempt for them by the expression on your face or by what you say. 

#### Rule 3.

>   Above all, anger, irritation, jealousy, depression, sour feelings, morose thoughts, worry, should be forever banished from mind by the resolute, masterful Will. All these are physiological devils. They not only disturb the mind, but injure the body by developing poisons and distorting cells.

*[anger]: Anger is the strong emotion that you feel when you think that someone has behaved in an unfair, cruel, or unacceptable way. 
*[irritation]: Irritation is a feeling of annoyance, especially when something is happening that you cannot easily stop or control. 
*[jealousy]: Jealousy is the feeling of anger or bitterness which someone has when they think that another person is trying to take a lover or friend, or a possession, away from them. 
*[depression]: Depression is a mental state in which you are sad and feel that you cannot enjoy anything, because your situation is so difficult and unpleasant. 
*[sour]: If you refer to someone's attitude as sour grapes, you mean that they say that something is worthless or undesirable because they want it themselves but cannot have it. 
*[morose]: Someone who is morose is miserable, bad-tempered, and not willing to talk very much to other people. 
*[worry]: Worry is the state or feeling of anxiety and unhappiness caused by the problems that you have or by thinking about unpleasant things that might happen


#### Rule 4.

> Resolve, then, upon the following perpetual regimes

1. Determine to live in a regular manner. Nevertheless, be master of rules, not slave.
2. Shun rich pastries and foods and drink which stimulate but do not nourish.
3. Keep the body clean. Bathe frequently, always rinsing in fresh water, cooler than the first, unless you are convalescent, and dry thoroughly. 

*[rinsing]: If you rinse your mouth, you wash it by filling your mouth with water or with a liquid that kills germs, then spitting it out. 
*[convalescent]: to recover health and strength gradually after sickness or weakness 

#### Rule 5.

>   Attention! A bit of perfumery dropped into the bath, or applied thereafter, will cultivate physical pride, not vanity, which will prize the body and make clean flesh a delight.

*[vanity]: If you refer to someone's vanity, you are critical of them because they take great pride in their appearance or abilities. 

#### Rule 6.	

>    After vigorous drying, rub and knead and slap for a few minutes. If the bath has been taken during the day, keep up a gentle but resolute activity a short time before going out of the dressing room. Then assume a self-possessed and assertive mood of mind, with Will strongly at the fore.
>
> If the bath is taken before retiring, get into a clean garment, and then sprawl over every foot of bed-linen, of a proper temperature, luxuriating, resting, conscious of being a clean and very good sort of person. Now note with shut eyes what you see of colors and shapes in the inky darkness before you, and sleep.

*[vigorous]: Vigorous physical activities involve using a lot of energy, usually to do short and repeated actions
*[rub]: If you rub a part of your body, you move your hand or fingers backwards and forwards over it while pressing firmly. 
*[knead]: If you knead a part of someone's body, you press or squeeze it with your fingers.
*[slap]: If you slap someone, you hit them with the palm of your hand. 
*[self-possessed]: Someone who is self-possessed is calm and confident and in control of their emotions.
*[assertive]: Someone who is assertive states their needs and opinions clearly, so that people take notice. 


*[garment]: A garment is a piece of clothing; used especially in contexts where you are talking about the manufacture or sale of clothes. 
*[sprawl]: If you sprawl somewhere, you sit or lie down with your legs and arms spread out in a careless way. 


#### Rule 7.

>   Drink at least four full glasses of pure water every day unless you are too fleshy, in which case consult a physician. For most people more would probably be better. In addition, drink whenever you want water, except when heated. If heated, refresh the mouth by rinsing, but do not swallow for a time. Of course it is here supposed that you have stopped exercise in a heated condition. Drink at your meals, before, after. Don't gulp ice-water. Don't boil your stomach with hissing hot water. A good drink is composed of rather hot water with milk to color well, and enough salt to taste. Drink water freely before retiring. 

*[fleshy]: If you describe someone as fleshy, you mean that they are slightly too fat
*[gulp]: If you gulp something, you eat or drink it very quickly by swallowing large quantities of it at once.
*[hiss]: To hiss means to make a sound like a long 's'.

#### Rule 8.

> Make sure of pure air in your sleeping room. Don't sleep in a draft. If possible sleep with head away from open door or window. Place a light screen between yourself and the source of air. See to it, however, that the pure air can get to you. Don't sleep in a hot room. Don't sleep in a freezing atmosphere. 

*[draft]: a device for regulating the flow of air (as in a fireplace)

#### Rule 9.	

>  Keep your sleeping room clean. Make it attractive. That room ought to be the best in the house. It is frequently the poorest. If it is a small hired room, sacrifice many things for furniture, pictures, ornaments, articles of toilet. Do not suppose that, because you are a male biped, you are above these suggestions. You are occupied with dirt all day; why not get away from dirt at night? Man is an animal with a soul, and therefore may not wisely "bunk down" like a dog, or "stall in " like a horse or an ox. 

*[ornament]: An ornament is an attractive object that you display in your home or in your garden or yard. 
*[bunk]: A bunk is a bed that is fixed to a wall, especially in a ship or caravan.

#### Rule 10.

> Keep body and clothing as clean as possible. 

#### Rule 11.

> Similarly as to good music. "Take a music bath once or twice a week for a few seasons," said Dr. O. W. Holmes, " and you will find that is to the soul what the water bath is to the body." This elevates and tends to maintain the tone of one's mind. Seek, therefore, every clean opportunity for hearing it. Purchase some kind of instrument for the home, and see that its beneficent harmonies are often heard. Let music be as much a part of the day's routine as eating or reading or working.

*[season]: A season is a period in which a play or show, or a series of plays or shows, is performed in one place.
*[harmonies]: Harmony is the pleasant combination of different notes of music played at the same time.
