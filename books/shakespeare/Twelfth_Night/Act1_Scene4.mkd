_Enter Valentine, and Viola in man's attire_

**VALENTINE**

If the Duke continue these favours towards
you, Cesario, you are [like][1] to be much advanced. He hath
known you but three days, and already you are no
stranger.

[1]: {{page.q}}=19137 "like (adv.) 1:  likely, probable / probably"


**VIOLA**

You either fear his [humour][3] or my negligence, that
you call in question the [continuance][4] of his love. Is he
inconstant, sir, in his favours?

**VALENTINE**

No, believe me.
_Enter Orsino, Curio, and attendants_



**VIOLA**

I thank you. Here comes the Count.



**ORSINO**

Who saw Cesario, ho?



**VIOLA**

On your attendance, my lord, here.



**ORSINO**

_to Curio and attendants_
Stand you awhile aloof. (To Viola) Cesario,
Thou knowest no less but all. I have [unclasp][5]ed
To thee the book even of my secret soul.
Therefore, good youth, [address][6] thy [gait][7] unto her.
Be not denied access; stand at her doors,
And tell them, there thy fixed foot shall grow
Till thou have audience.

**VIOLA**

Sure, my noble lord,
If she be so abandoned to her sorrow
As it is spoke, she never will admit me.



**ORSINO**

Be clamorous and leap all [civil][9] [bound][8]s
Rather than make unprofited return.

**VIOLA**

Say I do speak with her, my lord, what then?



**ORSINO**

O, then unfold the passion of my love.
[Surprise][11] her with [discourse][10] of my dear faith.
It shall [become][12] thee well to act my woes;
She will [attend][14] it better in thy youth
Than in a [nuncio][16]'s of more grave [aspect][15].

**VIOLA**

I think not so, my lord.



**ORSINO**

Dear lad, believe it.
For they shall yet [belie][17] thy happy years
That say thou art a man. Diana's lip
Is not more smooth and [rubious][19]. Thy small [pipe][18]
Is as the maiden's organ, shrill and [sound][20],
And all is [semblative][22] a woman's [part][21].
I know thy [constellation][24] is right [apt][23]
For this affair. Some four or five [attend][25] him â€“
All, if you will; for I myself am best
When least in company. Prosper well in this,
And thou shalt live as freely as thy lord,
To call his fortunes thine.

I'll do my best
To woo your lady. (Aside) Yet, a [barful][26] strife!
Whoe'er I woo, myself would be his wife.
