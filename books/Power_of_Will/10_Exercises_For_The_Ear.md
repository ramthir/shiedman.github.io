### REGIMES

#### Exercise No. 1

> How many sounds are now demanding your attention? Count them. Listen! Try to distinguish: Their different directions; their different causes; their different tones; their difference in strength; their different qualities[^1]; their different groupings.

*[demanding]: If you demand something such as information or action, you ask for it in a very forceful way

[^1]: The perceived quality of any sound, such as bright or dull, wooden or metallic, etc. is called timbre. Musicians use the term 'tone color' to describe the way instruments sound together or separately. An 18th century scientist, named Joseph Fourier (1768 - 1830), proved mathematically that any sound is actually made up of a set of multiple frequencies called the harmonic series.

#### Exercise No. 2

> Single out some one prominent sound, and note everything which you can possibly say about it. 

*[prominent]: Something that is prominent is very noticeable or is an important part of something else.

#### Exercise No. 3

> Select the faintest sound that continues coming to you. In doing this try to distinguish some regular sound which you have not hitherto noticed. Note everything that can be said concerning it.

*[hitherto]: up to this or that time


#### Exercise No. 4

> Single out some one of the sounds that come regularly to you. Attend to this sound alone. Shut out all other sounds. Be filled with it. Become absorbed in it. Note everything which can be said of it.


#### Exercise No. 5

> Select the most pleasant sound that continues to come to you. Note all possible reasons for its pleasantness. Do not fall into reverie.

*[reverie]: A reverie is a state of imagining or thinking about pleasant things, as if you are dreaming.

#### Exercise No. 6

>  **Listen carefully once to some simple melody played upon an organ or a piano. Try now to build up in your soul that melody entirely from memory.** You may remember a note[^2] or two, but will forget the most of it. If, however, you are persistent, you can gradually reconstruct the lost tune. The author has often accomplished this building up of music. Make the exercise a frequent task.

[^2]: sign used to represent such a sound in a manuscript or in printed music （乐谱上的）音符


#### Exercise No. 7

> While one is striking the keys of a piano, first one, then another, endeavor, without looking at the player, to distinguish the notes, whether sharp or flat, position on the board, and name of each note.
>
> Repeat with two keys, one hand striking. Repeat with four keys, both hands striking. Repeat with full chord, one hand striking. Repeat with full chords, both hands striking. Practice in the above exercises should be continued until you can detect improvement in compass of hearing, correctness of hearing, control over hearing. Do not become discouraged. The purpose is Will. Resolve to go on to the end. That end is Will power.
> 
>Do nothing without thought. Put the soul into the ear in all these exercises, willing, with great energy, attention to all sounds, or to one, or to none, as the case may be.

-------------------
Perhaps your hearing is defective and you are not aware of the fact. Or the defect may be due to a want of acute attention. In order to ascertain the real difficulty, the following exercise is suggested:

#### Exercise No. 8

> When all is quiet, hold a watch at arm's length from the right ear. Do you hear it ticking? No? Move the watch gradually nearer the ear until you hear. Note the distance at which the ticking first becomes audible. Write the result and mark "Ear No. 8," and date.

#### Exercise No. 9

> Never fight disagreeable noises by attending to them. Select some particularly hateful sound which comes to you regularly. Make this a practice for the day. Now, by an enormous effort of Will attend so powerfully to some other sound or many sounds as to shut out the one you wish to banish.

#### Exercise No. 10

> At night, when you are disturbed by hideous noises, stop thinking about them. Insist that you do not care anyway. Think of a particularly pleasant tune; or thought; or experience. Do not work[^3]: take the matter easily. Call up, mentally, a sound which is totally different from the one that disturbs you. Cause it to run in the mind, taking care that it has a certain regularity and rhythm. Imagine the loud ticking of a large clock, or the droning of an old-fashioned waterwheel, or the steady booming of the sea.


*[hideous]: You can describe an event, experience, or action as hideous when you mean that it is very unpleasant, painful, or difficult to bear. 

[^3]: When you work, you spend time and effort doing a task that needs to be done or trying to achieve something.
